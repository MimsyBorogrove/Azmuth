My first real electronics project, an Arduino/NeoPixel based watch.

Note: This is very much a dynamic project for now. This is as much a learning experience for me as it is an actual device. As such, any and all of the software and hardware is subject to change, potentially a lot. Feel free to make use of it, but for now, don't expect stability.
